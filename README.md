# Python-GUIs
Testing a few projects using PyQt5 and QtDesigner.

In this repository i'll be posting some projects about GUIs fully written in python and using the PyQt5 module and QtDesigner for the design of the GUI. Currently you can find two projects: A simple calculator app and a little fishing "game" that I created using csv files for the data base and a little bit of pygame for the background music. The rest of the app functionalities are written in standard Python. Feel free to check the code and add some suggestions :)

Here you have links to youtube videos to see a demo of these GUI's usage:\n
